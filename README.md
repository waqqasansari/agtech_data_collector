**AGTECH Data Collector**
==========================

**Overview**

The AGTECH Data Collector is a Python-based project that collects, processes, and stores agricultural data from various sources. The project uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping and stores the collected data in CSV files.

**Project Structure**

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

* `config/`: Configuration files, including `config.yaml` which stores state names, file names, keys, and other settings.
* `data/`: Collected data stored in CSV files, one file per state.
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
* `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
* `src/`: Source code for the project, organized into subdirectories:
	+ `data_collection/`: Python scripts for data collection, including `base_collector.py` which contains the BeautifulSoup scraping logic.
	+ `data_preprocessing/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and cleaning.
	+ `data_storage/`: Python scripts for storing the collected data in CSV files.
	+ `main.py`: The main script that orchestrates the data collection, processing, and storage.

**How to Use**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/waqqasansari/agtech-data-collector.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the project by editing `config/config.yaml`
4. Run the data collector: `python src/main.py`
